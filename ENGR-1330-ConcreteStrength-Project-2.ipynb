    "## Concrete Strength Predictor Final Project - Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compressive Strength of Concrete determines the quality of Concrete. \n",
    "The strength is determined by a standard crushing test on a concrete cylinder, that requires engineers to build small concrete cylinders with different combinations of raw materials and test these cylinders for strength variations with a change in each raw material. \n",
    "The recommended wait time for testing the cylinder is 28 days to ensure correct results, although there are formulas for making estimates from shorter cure times.\n",
    "The formal 28-day approach consumes a lot of time and labor to prepare different prototypes and test them; the method itself is error prone and mistakes can cause the wait time to drastically increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of reducing the wait time and reducing the number of combinations to try is to make use of digital simulations, where we can provide information to the computer about what we know and the computer tries different combinations to predict the compressive strength.\n",
    "This approach can reduce the number of combinations we can try physically and reduce the total amount of time for experimentation. \n",
    "But, to design such software we have to know the relations between all the raw materials and how one material affects the strength. \n",
    "It is possible to derive mathematical equations and run simulations based on these equations, but we cannot expect the relations to be same in real-world. \n",
    "Also, these tests have been performed for many numbers of times now and we have enough real-world data that can be used for predictive modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective(s):\n",
    "- Literature scan on concrete design, and utility of a predictive approach\n",
    "- Analyse an existing concrete compressive strength database and build a data model to predict the compressive strength of a concrete mixture.\n",
    "- Build an interface to allow users to enter concrete mixtures and return an estimated strength and an assessment of the uncertainty in the estimate\n",
    "- Build an interface to allow users to add observations to the underlying database, and automatically update the Data Model to incorporate the new observations"
